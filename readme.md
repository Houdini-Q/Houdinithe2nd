***Quintez Martin*** -
I'm a recreational basketball player, icon pixel artist, and now a future programmer. I was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee and I am 28 years old.

1. Ask me anything on slack.
2. I try to code everyday.
3. Lists are indeed fun.
4. It took me a slightly moderate amount of time to learn how to icon 2-D animations.
